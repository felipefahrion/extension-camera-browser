# extension-camera-browser

This project is a POC to a undergraduation thesis. 

For these project i realize to create a machine learning porcess using Tensorflow.js to control the page scroll (up and down), zoom (in, out), etc. using my own iamge.

I want to capture a video to send to Tensorflow trainng a model by those videos. After that, I capable to use my hands to control the pages TCHARAAAN! (This is only an idea)
